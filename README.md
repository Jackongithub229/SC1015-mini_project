# Problem Definition

# Models Used
  1. Linear Regression

# Conclusion
 1. Timing to buy COE.
    From our data, we can see that there is a 10 year gap between car de-registration. 
    You should target for that downtrend and then you should be able to buy it at a cheaper price

  2. COE price is determined by the amount of quota, The government will always release the number of quota before the price.
    Therefore, if you were to see a very high amount of quota announced, the quota premium price has a high chance to be lower.

  3. Our future plans is to continue researching on different types of trading algorithms and strategies that would maximise our project.
